**(for the Udemy edition, click [here](https://github.com/rockthejvm/udemy-akka-persistence))**

Powered by [Rock the JVM!](rockthejvm.com)

This repository contains the code we wrote during [Rock the JVM's Akka Persistence with Scala](https://rockthejvm.com/course/akka-persistence) course. Unless explicitly mentioned, the code in this repository is exactly what was caught on camera.

### How to install
- either clone the repo or download as zip
- open with IntelliJ as an SBT project

No need to do anything else, as the IDE will take care to download and apply the appropriate library dependencies.

### How to start

Clone this repository and checkout the `start` tag:

```
git checkout start
```

### How to run an intermediate state

The repository was built while recording the lectures. Prior to each lecture, I tagged each commit so you can easily go back to an earlier state of the repo!

The tags are as follows:

* `start`
* `1.1-scala-recap`
* `1.2-akka-recap`
* `2.2-persistent-actors`
* `2.3-persisting-extras`
* `2.4-persistent-actors-exercises`
* `2.5-multiple-persists`
* `2.6-snapshots`
* `2.7-recovery`
* `2.8-persist-async`
* `3.1-local-stores`
* `3.2-postgres`
* `3.3-cassandra`
* `3.4-custom-serialization`
* `4.1-event-adapters`
* `4.2-detaching-models`
* `4.3-persistence-query`

When you watch a lecture, you can `git checkout` the appropriate tag and the repo will go back to the exact code I had when I started the lecture.
